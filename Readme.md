# Journey to become a data scientist in natural langauge processing
This repository contains my log entries on my preparion for becoming a data scientist in natural language processing. In my previous role, I was mainly involved with research projects which provided ample opportunities of learning and personal growth. Howevever, I missed working on real world problems where I can witness impact of the developed solutions. 

To make the transition from academia to industry, I started refreshing my technical knowledge. In this direction, I decided to go deeper into natural language processing given its amazing capabilities to build intelligent systems with abilities to process and generate human languages. 

## NLP projects/posts
The following is the list of projects on which I worked on. I will keep on updating this list as I finish new projects.

1. [Understanding the basics of text processing: tokenization, lemmatization, vectorization](https://pankajchejara23.github.io/posts/post-with-code/basics_nlp.html)
2. [Building a sentiment classifier using Yelp Dataset using a basic vectorization appoarch](https://pankajchejara23.github.io/posts/post-with-code/Sentiment%20prediction.html)
